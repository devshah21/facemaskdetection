# facemaskdetection
Using YOLO (You Only Look Once), an object detection algorithm to detect face masks. 

###Annotating Images

I used Kaggle to download a dataset. After downloading this dataset, I used a graphical image annotating tool to label the images. The annotations should be saved as xml files. 

####Installation

'pip3 install labelImg
labelImg
labelImg [IMAGE_PATH] [PRE-DEFINED CLASS FILE]'
